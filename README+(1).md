## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- After reducing class imbalance the accuracy has increases.
- There is a slight indication of overfitting as the validation loss is higher and the validation accuracy is lower than the corresponding training metrics
- The model performance on the training data is good.
- Training accuracy is 72% indicate that training data is classified correctly by the model
